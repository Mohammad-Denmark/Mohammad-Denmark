As an IT Support Engineer, I have provided hardware, software, and network support to various clients across
different industries, such as Nielsen Media, Base Life Science, Rockwell Automation, Tiffany & Co and many
more. I have resolved support issues, administered and controlled information systems, and collaborated with
end users and vendors, using tools such as ServiceNow, M365, Teams, SharePoint, Windows Server, and Azure
AD. I have also earned multiple certifications in Microsoft Azure solutions, demonstrating my expertise in cloud
administration.
In addition to my IT support skills, I have a passion for web development and digital marketing, which I have
applied in my previous roles as a Web Developer at SlotssÃ¸ PalÃ¦et and PlanReact. I have created and
maintained WordPress websites, optimized them for SEO, generated traffic, data analysis, implemented email
marketing and funneling strategies, and managed Google Ad Campaigns. I have a Master's degree in Information
Technology from Federation University Australia, where I gained a solid foundation in web design, multimedia, and
information resources. My goal is to leverage my IT support and digital marketing skills to help businesses grow
and succeed. I am a stable, proactive, and optimistic person who can integrate with new environments, people,
and cultures.
